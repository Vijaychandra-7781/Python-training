"""A RegEx, or Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.

RegEx can be used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern.

Python has a built-in package called re, which can be used to work with Regular Expressions.

Import the re module:"""



"""why it is use
Regular expressions are particularly useful for defining filters.

Regular expressions contain a series of characters that define a pattern of text to be matchedâ€”to make a
 filter more specialized,"""

#The re module offers a set of functions that allows us to search a string for a match:

"""findall	Returns a list containing all matches
search	Returns a Match object if there is a match anywhere in the string
split	Returns a list where the string has been split at each match
sub	Replaces one or many matches with a string"""
